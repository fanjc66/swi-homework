Proof:

\because Positional Notation $(x){2}$ = \sum_{i=1}^{k} $d_{i}$ $2^{i-1}$

\because Two's complement N(x) = $2^{k}$ - x, where k is the number of bits for an integer and , N'(x) = $s^{m}$ - x where m>k

\therefore N'(x) = $2^{m}$ - 1 = (2-1) \sum_{i=1}^{m} $2^{i-1}$, that is m bits 1. So the same, ($2^{k}$-1) is k bits 1

\therefore if N(x) is a negative binary integer,  the most-significant bit can be repeated in all the extra bits.

$f(x) = \sum_{i=0}^{N} $d _{i}$ $2^{i-1}$
$$f(x) = \sum_{i=0}^{N}\int_{a}^{b} g(t,i) \text{ d}t{6}\tag{1}$$
